# Homebrew/cask-eid

These were casks for electronic identity card software of various countries. They were deleted for being complex, high maintenance, and having low download numbers. [We no longer accept submissions for them](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask/blob/master/doc/faq/rejected_casks.md), even on the other repositories.
